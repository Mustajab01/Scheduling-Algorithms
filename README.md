# Operating System Scheduling Algorithms

  

*Inspired from [Boonsuen's](https://github.com/boonsuen) [Work](https://boonsuen.com/process-scheduling-solver) on Scheduling Algorithm Website*

**Project Description:** A Web page to facilitate the input and output of scheduling algorithm data. The web page consists of two main sections:

1.  **Input Section:** This section allows users to input scheduling algorithm data, including the selection of a scheduling algorithm, arrival times, and burst times. Users can submit this data for processing.
    
2.  **Output Section:** This section is intended to display the output generated based on the user's input. While the specific functionality for generating scheduling algorithm outputs may be implemented later, this section is reserved for presenting the results.
